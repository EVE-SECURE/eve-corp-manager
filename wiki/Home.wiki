EVE Corp manager needs a snappier title

= Introduction =

Hello!

If you have found your way here hopefully you were looking for a corp management app for the MMO EVE Online. It is currently not at all ready since I am still getting the structure in place but I have posted it for the small group of people that are going to be working on it.


= Details =

This project is written in C# in Visual Studio 2012 targeting the .net framework 4. 

Using the EveAI library located at: http://wiki.eve-id.net/EveAI
